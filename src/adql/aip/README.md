# Example queries from AIP
This is a collection of example database queries from services provided 
by the Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP).

##cosmosim.xml: CosmoSim database queries
CosmoSim does not support ADQL (yet), however, a test dataset is now 
available at http://gavo.aip.de/tap, databases mdr1 and bolshoi.
The datasets are only an extract, which will make queries faster (and 
return fewer results) than on the complete datasets of CosmoSim.

The queries here are converted from MySQL to ADQL queries.
